        <p>-----Below are a number of projects I have worked on-----</p>
        <p><b>VMware</b></p>
        <ul>Configure VMware onto a fresh build and partition disk space to run a windows operating system </ul>
        <ul>Utilize Wireshark on the virtualized operating system to monitor network control via packets through TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, ping, and ipconfig by building a building an all-encompassing project</ul>
        <ul>Build a custom BATCH script leveraging automation to build custom Ipconfig, Netstat, Systeminfo, ping, route commands, and launch 3 web-based commands via chrome and autogenerate a nested folder to print command entries into text files</ul>
       
        <p><b>AWS Cloud Computing</b></p>
        <ul>Sign up for an AWS account and create a root user</ul>
        <ul>Manage billing and spending metrics through CloudWatch</ul>
        <ul>Assign users and group privileges via IAM</ul>
        <ul>Launch EC2 instances for Windows and Linux configured with security groups and custom inbound port rules</ul>
        <ul>Create a NoSQL Database using DynamoDB</ul>
        <ul>Build a web application via Elastic Beanstalk</ul>
       
       
        <p><b>SQL</b></p>
        <ul>Utilize the VMware’s virtual machine as a sandbox to practice SQL commands by downloading MySQL to the VM</ul>
        <ul>Create a database project from scratch by designing, building, and deploying custom tables</ul>
        <ul>Configure custom SQL commands to query the database and pull back specific use cases </ul>
        

        <p><b>Widows batch script</b></p>
        <ul>Create a .bat file to execute a number of system and network commands to test, diagnose, and troubleshoot software related issues</ul>
        <ul>Integrate the script to create a results directory</ul>
        <ul>Save terminal output to separate .txt files for easy retrieval and reference </ul>
        
        <p><b>Building a PC from scratch</b></p>
        <ul>Research parts, components, and materials needed to build a PC</ul>
        <ul>Purchase the following PC components: CPU (intel) = Core i3 10th gen, MB = Asus ROG Strix B550, RAM (DDR4) = Crucial 16GB 3200, Power supply = evga 650 bq 80+ bronze 650w, Case = LIAN LI 205 MESH TG RGB ATX BLACK, SSD = Samsung SSD 980, OS (Windows)</ul>
        <ul>Install PC components, power on pc, configure BIOS, upload windows OS, and have functional workstation</ul>
        

        <p><b>Selenium and Java</b></p>
        <ul>Sharpen JAVA understanding and Develop a variety of practice automation scripts using selenium to launch chrome browser, call URL’s, pass data (via hardcode as well as Data Driven Testing through Apache POI), and implement a validation check through TestNG </ul>
        <ul>Document a cookbook to explain common ways to implement automated strategies consisting of calling elements (by X path, ID, Name, etc.) executing (via click and submit), and multiple sources to find common areas to find help and assistance (Tutorials/Seminars/Training for Java walk throughs, selenium script tips, etc.)</ul>
        <b>Selenium and Java (Work Related)</b>

        <ul>Create a 270 smoke-test script using Java to run a full 270 transaction in RTVT against SIT (1,2, and 3) and UAT (1,2, and 3) environments</ul>
        <ul>Integrate the script to launch with chrome browser to login, run the transaction, and return results via a 271 eligibility and benefit response</ul>
        <ul>Use a print method to save responses both to the eclipse terminal for quick glance spot checking as well as export responses to a folder for easy convenience </ul>
        <ul>Develop a Custom 270 RTVT React Automation script via selenium </ul>
        <ul>Code a tailored java-based script to launch to call RTVT’s React endpoint </ul>
        <ul>Submit full 270 transactions to read from a custom method that will pull 270 file contents into React’s field entry</ul>
        <ul>Execute the 270 requests to generate 271 responses</ul>
        <ul>Save files using a loop method into an autogenerated folder and terminate once script has finished executing </ul> 
        <ul>Solution an application architecture providing a walkthrough of how the custom logic services the end user through the end-to-end automated script </ul>
